# Circuit Simulator

A simple Circuit Simulator built using **Tkinter** and **SchemDraw** for visualizing and calculating electrical circuits. This app allows users to place circuit components such as resistors, capacitors, and batteries, connect them with wires, and compute the current in the circuit based on input voltage and resistance values.

## Features

- **Circuit Elements**: 
    - Battery
    - Resistor (Horizontal and Vertical)
    - Capacitor (Horizontal and Vertical)
    - Ground
    - Connecting Wires
- **Current Calculator**: Calculate the current in the circuit using Ohm's Law (I = V / R).
- **Visual Circuit Design**: Draw and save the schematic of your circuit as an SVG file.
- **Interactive UI**: Add elements dynamically by clicking buttons, specify voltage and resistance, and visualize your circuit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SchemDraw
- Tkinter

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install **SchemDraw**:
   ```bash
   pip install SchemDraw
